🚀 About Me

I am a results-driven Backend Engineer with strong experience in building scalable, high-performance systems using Node.js, TypeScript, NestJS, Express, Restana, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB.

I specialise in:

Designing clean backend architecture

Building secure, production-ready APIs

Payment gateway integrations (Paystack, Piggyvest, Stripe, Flutterwave)

Multi-tenant systems, microservices, and distributed systems

CI/CD, caching, cloud infrastructure, and system optimisation

Beyond backend development, I also build frontends using React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and modern component libraries.

I’m passionate about solving real-world problems—particularly within automotive technology, where I also have hands-on diagnostics and mechanical experience.
